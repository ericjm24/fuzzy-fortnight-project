# Political Persuadability in Twitter
A large-scale project attempting to measure how politically persuadable a Twitter user is based on their profile.

Project Question:

	Cambridge Analytica used facebook data from 50 million users in the 2016 election to guess which users were most likely to be persuaded to change their minds, and then use this information to target voters. Can we try and kind-of replicate this effect using the information that is available to us now?

	If we canâ€™t, can we identify what information would be needed to be able to reliably do this?

Data Sources:

Social Media
Twitter
Demographics
Census
Poll information

Major Questions to be looked at:

Census data is available for different geographic regions during different census cycles. How do we accurately predict the current demographics of a location based on the history of the census data?

How do we build a graph of twitter followers to identify key players and perform data analysis?

Data validation: History of polls and advertising data. Can we look at the history of polls and advertising as a way to validate our data?

How do we combine all the information we have into a guess of how likely a person is to be swayed by advertising?

Future Question: How do we design our messaging to best sway people?
