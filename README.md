# Political Persuadability in Twitter
A large-scale project attempting to measure how politically persuadable a Twitter user is based on their profile.

Project looks to be focusing on politics in some way. Docs can be held at a google drive for now, all code goes here.

Project Question:

	Cambridge Analytica used facebook data from 50 million users in the 2016 election to guess which users were most likely to be persuaded to change their minds, and then use this information to target voters. Can we try and kind-of replicate this effect using the information that is available to us now?

	If we can’t, can we identify what information would be needed to be able to reliably do this?

Data Sources:

Social Media
Facebook
Twitter
Demographics
Census
Election Information
FEC
Secretaries of State Offices
Poll information

Major Questions to be looked at:

Census data is available for different geographic regions during different census cycles. How do we accurately predict the current demographics of a location based on the history of the census data?

How do we build a graph of twitter/facebook followers to identify key players and do other sorts of data analytics. I need to study graph theory in order to be able to do this reliably.

Psychological profile based on facebook/twitter history. Can we identify somebody’s personality and political ideology from the information they have posted online?

Data validation: History of polls and advertising data. Can we look at the history of polls and advertising as a way to validate our data?

How do we combine all the information we have into a guess of how likely a person is to be swayed by advertising?

Future Question: How do we design our messaging to best sway people?
